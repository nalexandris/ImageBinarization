# ImageBinarization
An attempt on implemeting an Image Binarization algorithm.


16-bit wide sectors are created and check the average color saturation of the sector, a threshold is set and the binarization 
starts on that sector. The operation continues until the image is covered. This project is an experimental test and nothing more.
